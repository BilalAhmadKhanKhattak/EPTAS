# EPTAS - Every Picture Tells A Story
"Sometimes, life's most challenging moments give birth to the most meaningful creations."

## About EPTAS
EPTAS (Every Picture Tells A Story) is more than just a tool, it’s a reflection of turning struggles into something productive. Built during a time of mental disturbance, EPTAS stands as a testament to how creativity and passion can help channel emotions into something constructive.

This tool extracts metadata from images, including camera details, timestamps, etc. It's not just about technical utility; it’s about uncovering the hidden stories that every picture holds.

##  Features
- Extracts metadata such as Date, Camera Model, Software, and more.
- Reveals GPS information (maybe yes, maybe no) to trace where the photo was taken.
- Supports common image formats like .jpg and .png.

## A Note from the Creator
This project is a piece of me, born out of a small, rough "time interval" in life. If you’re going through something similar, know this: you can always find strength in creating, no matter what the world throws at you. Keep pushing forward.
